    <h1>My first web development project!</h1>
    <p>Hello dear reader, and welcome to my web page! This is my very first time creating something like this, 
    so i hope that it turns out well.  Let's get started!</p>
    <h2>Silly Animals</h2>
    <p>One thing that i realised while making this was that the most difficult part about creating a website is 
        choosing what it's going to be about. Should i talk about Nazis? How about a game or a movie? Music should be good too 
        right? After a good 20 minutes of thinking i decided something - the first video i see when i open youtube will 
        be my topic. And the outcome? silly little animals, something that i cannot imagine anyone hating XD
    </p>

    <p>He's just a silly guy.<br> What we see in this video is a happy lil rabbit. How do we know? when rabbits are happy, they get zoomies, just like cats and dogs. This guy probably just had dinner XD</p>

    <h3>Deep Conversations</h3>
    <p>DO NOT be fooled!! Theyre plotting something evil!<br> Cats purr when they are content. These two must be close!</p>

    <h3>Hellooooo</h3>
    <p>Apex predator? No thanks I'll pet the dog. <br>This bear realised that waving to humans can get him treats. Good to see that he's utilising his talent well.</p>
